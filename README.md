# OSProject
Custom OS Project write in C just for learning purposes.

## Motivation
I'm graduated at Mechatronics Engineering, so I decided to dive deep down in the low level programing, learning how OS boot the computer,
how drivers was coded and more.

## Goal
My goal is to reach a simple file system, although I am not sure if I will reach it.

## Branches

### Master
Contains the most updated code, using the Grub Multiboot as bootloader

### Custom boot
Contains an old version with a custom bootloader in assembly, configuring the plain GDT and loading data from disk.
